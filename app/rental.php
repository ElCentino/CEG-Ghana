        I understand that I have entered into a Textbook Rental Agreement with The College Store at Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
        I have read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions as described below. I am at least 18 years of age
        and have entered into this Textbook Rental Agreement with The College Store of my own free will. I understand that
        the rented textbook is the property of The College Store and that I will return the rented textbook in saleable condition
        to The College Store. I am responsible for any loss or theft of the rented textbook. I will secure the rented textbook(s)
        with Visa, MasterCard or debit card at the time of the order. I can rent designated textbooks at any time during
        the semester while supplies last. The Rental Fee entitles me to use the rented textbook for the entire semester in
        which it was rented. I may return the rented textbook early but will not be reimbursed for any portion of the Rental
        Fee.
